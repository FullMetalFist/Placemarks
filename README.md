## Thoughts

Building an app in SwiftUI is fun.
I'm glad Apple is sharing resources to help us discover the API
with a tangible use case.
The challenging bit was understanding @Binding, @State, @EnvironmentObject
when to use them & so forth. Take time to read documentation on [@Binding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/binding), [@State](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state), & [@EnvironmentObject](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentobject)

I do wish they had sample code on how to use [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/)
